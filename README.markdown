# Agile Delivery Network

This is the source code for the website at [http://adn.heroku.com](http://adn.heroku.com)

## How to Join

Membership of the ADN is currently by invitation only.

If you'd like to join, speak to [one of the existing members](http://adn.heroku.com) and see whether they'll refer you. It will help if you've worked with them on a project in the past.

If you've been invited to join the network, here's the preferred way to add your name to the website:

  * fork this repository
  * edit the file config/companies.json 
  * send me a pull request

We prefer it that way because the ADN is administered by volunteers and that's the method that's easiest for us. We'd also like you, as an ADN member, to feel some ownership over the content of the website and start to get your hands on it.

We do appreciate that not everyone will want that level of involvement, though. If all this sounds like too much hassle, just [email us](mailto:agile-delivery-network@googlegroups.com) with the details you'd like to see on the site (name, brief description, URL and logo URL) and we'll take care of the rest.
