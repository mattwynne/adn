# Agile Delivery Network

This is the source code for the website at [http://adn.heroku.com](http://adn.heroku.com)

## How to Join

Membership of the ADN is currently by invitation only. If you know or have worked with someone who's already a member, speak to them about how you can get involved.

## Adding your Details

If you've been invited to join the network, here's the preferred way to add your name to the website:

  * fork this repository
  * edit the file config/companies.json 
  * send me a pull request
  
### Sounds like too much hassle?

Remember we're an agile organisation, and this is the first iteration of our sign-up process. We also want to encourage you, as an ADN member, to take some ownership over the content of the organisation's website and start to get your hands on it.

We do appreciate that not everyone will want that level of involvement, though. If that's you, just [drop us a line](mailto:agile-delivery-network@googlegroups.com?subject=My details&body=Please include name, a brief description, URL and logo URL) and one of the other members will be happy to take care of it.
